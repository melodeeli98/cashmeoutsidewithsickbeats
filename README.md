# Cash Me Outside With Sick Beats

Play music depending on the weather!

This project was created at Hackhers 2017 at Rutgers University. We wanted to create and simple and fun web app that could make an arbitrary task such as checking the weather more fun. We believe this web app will particularly be useful for people with physical disabilities and may not be able to easily use technology to access the weather on their own.

The web app takes in a zip code from the user, checks the weather of that location, and returns a playlist of music fitting the weather. For example if it was sunny the playlist would include the songs like "Pocket Full of Sunshine" and "California Gurls".

The web app was built with Python using the Flask framework. The webpage was designed using HTML and CSS. We were able to get the weather based on the user's location through the Open Weather Map API, as well as the playlists from the Spotify API. Both of these APIs were implemented using Javascript.
